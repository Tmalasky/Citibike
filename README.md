# Citibike
Looking at Citibike Data using Tableau to make charts and graphs to show data.

# Overview of Analysis
### Using Tableau to help convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
### By using Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations using Tableau to: Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Summary
### Looking at the visualizations you can see bikes are checked out (on average) 6-7 minutes a ride. I would suggest looking deeper into the most popular stations and time used to see if there is a correlation. Also, the bike trips vary by the hour of the day with the peak hours being 5-6pm and 7am maybe due to people using them to ride to and from work. Maybe look at the data to see if there is a correlation to station usage near the busiest work locations also.
